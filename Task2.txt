1) What is contineous integration?
=> It is a method of merging multiple piece of code multiple times into a repository by preventing integration problems.

2) Why we need contineous integration?
=>We need CI in order to get feedback on integrated code so that if a defect is found into the code
  then it can be identified and corrected as soon as possible

3) How do we achieve contineous integration?
=>* Maintain a code repository
  * Automate the build
  * Make the build self-testing
  * Everyone commits to the baseline every day
  * Every commit should be built
  * Keep the build fast
  * Test in a clone of the production environment

4) What is Software configutation management(SCM)?
=>SCM is a way to keep track of the changes made in the code and sharing the info to team mates 
  that what changes are made,by whom and when. It help in maintaining coordination among the team member.

5) Types of SCM?
=>Concurrent Versions System(CVS),SubVersion(SVN), Git.

6) When to use which type of SCM?
=> * If you want to have a single master source tree which is to be used by a small group, then SVN 
     should be preferred.
  
   * If your project is open to many where several programmers are going to be working at different 
     times and submitting several updates to the code, then Git should be preferred.
